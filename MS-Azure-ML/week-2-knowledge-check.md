# Microsoft Azure Machine Leaning
## Week 2 Knowledge Check

### True or False? Regression is a form of machine learning that is used to predict an item’s feature based on the numeric label.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

*Regression is a machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to fit the feature combinations to the label.*

### In order to use Azure Machine Learning, what should you create in your Azure subscription?

- [x] A Machine Learning Workspace
- [ ] An App Service Plan
- [ ] A SQL Server

*You can use this workspace to manage data, compute resources, code, models, and other artifacts related to your machine learning workloads. *

### Suppose you created a machine learning model and you want to train it. Which compute target should you use?

- [ ] Compute Instances.
- [ ] Inference Clusters
- [x] Compute Clusters

*Compute Clusters are scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code. *

### True or False? To train a regression model, you need a dataset that includes historical features and known label values.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

*To train a regression model, you need a dataset that includes historical features and known label values.*

### You are planning on using Azure Machine Learning. From a payment plan perspective, what costs should you expect?

- [ ] One-time license
- [ ] Monthly subscription
- [x] Pay-for-what-you-use

*Azure Machine Learning enables the use of cloud-based compute resources that scale effectively to handle large volumes of data. With this cloud-based service you only pay for the Azure Machine Learning resources that you use.​*
