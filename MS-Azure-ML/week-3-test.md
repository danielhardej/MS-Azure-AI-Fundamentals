# Microsoft Azure Machine Leaning
## Week 3 Test

#### Which metric presents the ratio of correct predictions (true positives + true negatives) to the total number of predictions?

- [x] Accuracy
- [ ] Recall
- [ ] F1 Score
- [ ] Precision

*Accuracy presents the ratio of correct predictions (true positives + true negatives) to the total number of predictions.*

#### You use an Azure Machine Learning designer pipeline to train and test a binary classification model. You review the model's performance metrics in an Evaluate Model module, and note that it has an AUC score of 0.6. What can you conclude about the model?

- [ ] The model can explain 60% of the variance between true and predicted labels.
- [x] The model performs better than random guessing
- [ ] The model predicts accurately for 40% of cases

*The higher the score of AUC, the better the performance of the model.*

#### Which metric presents the fraction of positives cases correctly identified?

- [ ] F1 Score
- [ ] Accuracy
- [x] Precision
- [ ] Recall

*Precision presents the fraction of positive cases correctly identified (the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false positives)*

#### Which of the following scenarios can be resolved by applying classification models?

- [ ] A company who wants to predict the churn rate of their subscribers for next month.
- [x] A bank wanting to determine if a specific set of clients are eligible for taking a loan.
- [x] A toy company wanting to determine which clients are inclined to buy a specific toy.

*Classification is a form of machine learning that is used to predict which category, or class, an item belongs to.*

#### Which of the following are models that help predict between two or several categories?

- [x] Two-class logistic regression
- [ ] Linear Regression
- [x] Two-class decision forest
- [x] Multi-class neural network

*Two-class decision forests and Two-class logistic regressions help predict between two categories, while Multi-class neural networks help predict between several categories.*

#### True or False? Classification is an example of a supervised machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to fit the feature combinations to the label.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

*Classification is an example of a supervised machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to fit the feature combinations to the label.*

#### You are using Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline for a binary classification model.At some point, you want to separate the data into training and testing sets. Which model should you add to the pipeline?

- [x] Split data
- [ ] Join data
- [ ] Select columns in dataset

*Split data module is particularly useful when you need to separate data into training and testing sets.*
