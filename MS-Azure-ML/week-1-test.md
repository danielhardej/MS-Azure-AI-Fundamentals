## Week 1 Test

#### A hospital wants to categorize patients that are pregnant as low-risk or high-risk regarding complications based on data like patient age and known medical conditions. What kind of machine learning model should the hospital use?

- [x] Classification
- [ ] Time series forecasting
- [ ] Regression

*To predict a category, or class, a classification model can be used.*

#### Which of the following are machine learning models? Select all that apply.

- [ ] Polarization
- [x] Time series forecasting
- [x] Regression

#### A meteorological institute wants to predict, based on data from the past, how much it will rain next Sunday. What machine learning model is the best fit for this case?

- [ ] Regression
- [ ] Classification
- [x] Time series forecasting

*Time series forecasting enables predictions of numeric values at a future point in time.*

#### A toy company wants to predict the daily demand in order to assure that they have the necessary stock to honour all orders. What machine learning model can be used in this case?

- [x] Regression
- [ ] Classification
- [ ] Clustering

*Regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to predict numeric values.*

#### True or False? Azure Machine Learning includes an automated machine learning capability that leverages the scalability of cloud compute to automatically try multiple pre-processing techniques and model-training algorithms in parallel to find the best performing supervised machine learning model for your data.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

#### True or False? A bike rental company can use historic data to train a model that predicts daily rental demand in order to make sure sufficient staff and cycles are available.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

*A regression model can fulfil this task.*

#### What setting should you configure if you want to end the experiment if the model achieves a certain score or less on normalized root mean squared error metric?

- [ ] Blocked algorithms
- [x] Metric score threshold
- [ ] Training compute target

*This metric causes the experiment to end if a model achieves a certain score (or less) on normalized root mean squared error.*
