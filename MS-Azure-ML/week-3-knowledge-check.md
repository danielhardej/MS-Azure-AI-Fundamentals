#### True or False? Classification is a form of machine learning that is used to predict which category, or class, an item belongs to.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

*Classification is a form of machine learning that is used to predict which category, or class, an item belongs to.*

#### You use Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline for a classification model. What must you do before deploying the model as a service?

- [ ] Add an Evaluate Model module to the training pipeline
- [x] Create an inference pipeline from the training pipeline
- [ ] Clone the training pipeline with a different name

*An inference pipeline must be created in order to deploy as a service.*

#### A health clinic is planning on using datasets that contain characteristics of patients to predict whether the patient has a risk of diabetes or not. Can this task be accomplished with the help of classification?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

*In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the features, and the label is a classification of either 0 or 1, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.*

#### What values/cases does a confusion matrix present?

- [x] True negatives
- [x] False positives
- [x] True positives
- [x] False negatives

*A confusion matrix shows the following cases: true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives.*

#### What are the two best metrics to assess model classification performance?

- [x] Recall
- [x] Precision
- [ ] Accuracy

*Most data scientists use metrics like precision and recall to assess classification model performance.*
