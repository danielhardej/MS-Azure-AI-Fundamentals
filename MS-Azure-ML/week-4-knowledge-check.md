#### True or False? Clustering is a form of machine learning that is used to group similar items into clusters based on their predictions.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

*Clustering is a form of machine learning that is used to group similar items into clusters based on their features.*

#### What type of machine learning technique does clustering examples?

- [ ] Reinforcement
- [x] Unsupervised
- [ ] Supervised

*Clustering is an example of unsupervised machine learning.*

#### You create a machine learning experiment based on a clustering model. Now you want to use the model in an inference pipeline. Which module should you use to infer cluster predictions from the model?

- [x] Assign data to clusters
- [ ] Train clustering model
- [ ] Score model

*Assign Data to Clusters module generates cluster predictions from a trained clustering model.*

#### When using a clustering module, what algorithm letâ€™s you group items into a number of clusters you specify?

- [ ] B: L-Means algorithm
- [x] K-Means algorithm
- [ ] C-Means algorithm

*The K-Means algorithm groups items into the number of clusters you specify.*

#### Suppose you are testing a K-Means clustering model. If you would want your model to assign items to one of four clusters, which parameter/property should you configure on the module?

- [x] Set number of centroids to 4
- [ ] Set random seed to 4
- [ ] Set stratified split

*The number of centroids defines the number of clusters.*
