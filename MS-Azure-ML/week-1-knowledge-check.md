#### True or False? Machine learning is a technique that uses statistics to create a model that can predict unknown values.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

*Machine learning is a technique that uses mathematics and statistics to create a model that can predict unknown values.*

#### What model is best suited for predicting categories or classes?

- [x] Classification
- [ ] Time series forecasting
- [ ] Regression

*Classification is best suited for predicting categories or classes.*

#### True or False? The “Predicted vs. True” chart shows a diagonal trend in which the predicted value correlates closely to the true value.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

*The “Predicted vs. True” chart should show a diagonal trend in which the predicted value correlates closely to the true value.*

#### If you want to automatically pre-process the features before training, what setting should you use?

- [ ] Training job time
- [ ] Explain best model
- [x] Enable featurization

*Enable featurization causes Azure Machine Learning to automatically pre-process the features before training.*

#### In a residual histogram, what do residuals represent?

- [ ] Variance between predicted and false values that can be explained by the model
- [x] Variance between predicted and true values that cannot be explained by the model
- [ ] Variance between predicted and false values that cannot be explained by the model

*Residuals represent variance between predicted and true values that can't be explained by the model.*
