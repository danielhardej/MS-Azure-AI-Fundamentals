# Microsoft Azure Machine Leaning
## Week 4 Test

#### Which of the following is a clustering algorithm?

- [x] K-Means
- [ ] Two-Class Neural Network
- [ ] Two-Class Logistic Regression

*K-Means is a clustering algorithm.*

#### What is the purpose of a clustering model?

- [ ] Answers simple two-choice questions
- [ ] Separates similar data points into intuitive groups
- [ ] Makes forecasts by estimating the relationship between values

*Clustering models have the purpose of separating similar data points into intuitive groups.*

#### Which of the following scenarios can be resolved by applying clustering modules/algorithms? Select all that apply.

- [x] A radio company that wants to apply tags (like rock, pop, R&B etc) to songs or artists.
- [ ] A bike rental company that wants to predict the number of customers for the next day so that it will assure the necessary staff and cycles.
- [x] A social media company that wants to group similar users based on their posts.

#### When evaluating a clustering model, what metrics can you visualize in the Evaluate results section? Select all that apply.

- [x] Average distance to cluster center
- [x] Average distance to other center
- [x] Maximal distance to cluster center
- [x] Number of points

*The metrics that can be visualized in the Evaluate results section of a clustering module are: Average distance to other center, Average distance to cluster center, Number of points, Maximal distance to cluster center.*

#### You are building an Azure Machine learning pipeline that involves a clustering module. You need to prepare the data and change some of the numeric values from the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Which module should you apply?

- [ ] Edit metadata
- [ ] Split data
- [x] Normalize Data

*The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.*

#### True or False? Clustering is an example of supervised machine learning, in which you train a model to separate items into clusters based purely on their characteristics or features.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

*Clustering is an example of unsupervised machine learning, in which you train a model to separate items into clusters based purely on their characteristics or features.*

#### A Hospital Care chain wants to open a series of Emergency-Care wards within a region. The chain knows the location of all the maximum accident-prone areas in the region. They have to decide the number of the Emergency Units to be opened and the location of these Emergency Units, so that all the accident-prone areas are covered in the vicinity of these Emergency Units. Which type of machine learning model is best to be applied in this scenario?

- [x] Clustering
- [ ] Classification
- [ ] Regression

*Clustering models have the purpose of separating similar data points into intuitive groups. With clustering, the chain can group accidents by emergency units.*
