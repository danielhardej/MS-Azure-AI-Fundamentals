# Computer Vision in Microsoft Azure
## Classify Images with the Custom Vision Service - Knowledge Check Quiz

#### Image classification is a capability that is part of which cognitive service in Azure?

- [ ] Machine Learning
- [ ] Computer Vision
- [x] Custom Vision

*You can perform image classification using the Custom Vision service, available as part of the Azure Cognitive Services offerings.*

#### Which of the following scenarios are suitable use cases for image classification?

- [x] Evaluating images from X-ray or MRI devices could quickly classify specific issues
- [x] Evaluating key infrastructure for major disaster preparation efforts
- [ ] Determining which pictures are best to display on a product catalogue
- [x] Identifying specific products in online searches

*Classification is a machine learning technique that you can use to predict which category, or class, something belongs to.*

#### When you create a Custom Vision resource and access it for the first time, which options do you have available as configuration for the resource?

- [x] Prediction option only
- [x] Training option only
- [x] Both training and prediction options

*All three options are available as configuration. You can either choose to use your service for training, for predictions, or doing both activities.*

#### True or False? The simplest approach is to use a general Cognitive Services resource for both training and prediction. This means you only need to concern yourself with one endpoint and one key.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

*Creating a Cognitive Service for both training and prediction activities simplifies the management of endpoints and keys.*

#### You are using Custom Vision and you want to evaluate the performance of your trained model. Which metric indicates the percentage of the correct class predictions?

- [ ] Recall
- [x] Precision
- [ ] Average precision (AP)

*Precision metrics indicate what percentage of the class predictions made by the model were correct.*
